"""Gets the encoding as indexes for a character.

Encode the character as a list of pixels.
The pixels are represented by indexes in the contribution graph:
0 is at the top left corner, 6 at the bottom left corner, 7 at the top of the second column:
0 7  14 21 28
1 8  15 22 29
2 9  16 23 30
3 10 17 24 31
4 11 18 25 32
5 12 19 26 33
6 13 20 27 34
Only the five first lines are used such that if the drawing takes two days to appear, it will still be valid.
Otherwise, a pixel at the bottom of the graph would go to the top of the next column.

Args:
	character: The character to encode.

Returns:
	The encoding for the character as a tuple containing:
	- a list of indexes for the positions of each pixel of the character;
	- the width of the character including the free column after it.
